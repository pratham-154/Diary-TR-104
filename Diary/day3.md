### 2024-07-15: Task 3 - Designing Database Schema

On the third day, the focus shifted to designing a well-structured database schema to handle the project's data efficiently. MongoDB, a NoSQL database, was the chosen technology due to its flexibility with document-based storage and scalability. I started by identifying the key entities for the project, such as users, products, categories, and orders, ensuring that all critical data points were accounted for. Each entity was carefully analyzed to define its attributes, relationships, and data types. For instance, the user schema included fields for authentication, roles, and preferences, while the product schema covered details like name, price, stock, and category.

Normalization and indexing strategies were incorporated to optimize query performance and minimize redundancy. Reference and embedded relationships were used appropriately to maintain a balance between data integrity and access speed. By the end of the day, I had created a robust database schema, complete with Mongoose models, that laid the foundation for seamless backend functionality and efficient data management throughout the project lifecycle.
