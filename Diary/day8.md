### 2024-07-22: Task 8 - Implementing JWT Authentication

On Day 8, I implemented JSON Web Token (JWT) authentication for secure user access and sessions. JWT is a compact, URL-safe means of representing claims between two parties. I started by installing the necessary libraries, including `jsonwebtoken`, and configuring the backend to issue tokens upon successful login. This involved creating an authentication middleware to validate the tokens sent by users with each request. I then ensured that all protected routes were secured by this middleware, allowing only authenticated users to access sensitive data or perform certain actions.

The process also required managing token expiration and refreshing. I created logic to refresh tokens before they expired and ensured that users could log in again seamlessly if their token expired. This setup was vital for ensuring security and a smooth user experience. By the end of the day, the JWT authentication mechanism was fully integrated into the project, enabling secure and authenticated sessions for users.
