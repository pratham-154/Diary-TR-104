### 2024-08-01: Task 16 - Developing API for Product Details

On Day 16, I developed the API for fetching detailed information about individual products. This involved creating a new endpoint in the backend that accepted a product ID as a parameter and returned the associated product data. The API queried the MongoDB database to fetch the product's details, such as the description, price, specifications, and images. I also ensured that the API included proper error handling, returning a 404 error if a product with the specified ID was not found.

To improve performance, I added caching to the API to reduce the load on the database and speed up response times for frequently requested products. This cache stored product details for a set amount of time, ensuring that repeated requests for the same product would be served quickly. By the end of the day, the API for fetching product details was fully functional, providing detailed product information to the frontend.
